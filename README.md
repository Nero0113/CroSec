# ðŸ”¨ Setup

```
conda create -n CroSec python==3.10
conda activate CroSec
pip install -r requirements.txt
./setup_codeql.sh
```

# ðŸš€ 1. Get embeddings 

```
python ./scripts/get_emb.py
```

# ðŸš€ 2. Get similarity metrix

```
python ./scripts/get_simi.py
```

# ðŸš€ Train

To train a LoRA for security model, run:

```
python train_lora_sec.py
```

**We provide a trained LoRA plugin for Codegen to replicate our experiments.** You can download it from Google Drive:
