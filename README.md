```

# 🔨 Setup

```
conda create -n CroSec python==3.10
conda activate CroSec
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 🚀 Train

To train a LoRA for security model, run:

```
python train_lora_sec.py
```

**We provide a trained LoRA plugin for Codegen to replicate our experiments.** You can download it from Google Drive: 



# 🚀 TEST
